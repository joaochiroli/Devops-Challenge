## Challenge: Part 1
Continuous integration

Set up a new repository and CI pipeline using any code version provider
The pipeline should run the following steps:
- Install dependencies npm install
- Linter (ESLint) npm run lint
- Formatter (Prettier) npm run prettier
- Test (Jest) CI=true npm run test
- Build npm run build

The pipeline should be successful. 
Please provide some pull requests to show pass or fail status in the CI pipeline.


## Challenge: Part 2
Continuous Deployment and Load Testing 

Deploy the provided application to your chosen cloud provider using any service that runs the application as a Docker container. Then, create a test plan for the application's home page and generate a testing report using JMeter.

The application needs to:

Available for anyone with Internet access only during the challenge recording

## Challenge: Part 3
Monitoring system  

Deploy a Prometheus monitoring system on an Ubuntu cloud instance. The system should be secured and accessible through a reverse proxy, with proper authentication in place, and connected to an external Node Exporter. You can follow these steps: 
- Access the Server: Access your cloud instance via SSH using either the provided server password or an SSH key (if configured).
- Install Prometheus and Node Exporter:

Update your package list and install Prometheus with the following commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install prometheus
```
Verify the installation by checking the status of Prometheus services:
```
sudo service prometheus status
sudo service prometheus-node-exporter status
```
Completion Criteria

- Use NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests from your server's IP address to Prometheus' default ports as follows:

```
http://{YOUR-SERVER-IP}/ to Prometheus (<http://localhost:9090/>)
http://{YOUR-SERVER-IP}/metrics/ to the Node Exporter (<http://localhost:9100/>)
```

- Basic authentication is set up, requiring credentials to access both endpoints.
- Direct access to ports 9090 (Prometheus) and 9100 (Node Exporter) is blocked, and access is only allowed via NGINX.
- Prometheus is scraping metrics from an external Node Exporter running a same saver
